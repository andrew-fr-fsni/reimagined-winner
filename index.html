<h1>More about our Foodies Foundation</h1>
</div>

<div class="col-2">
<p>One of our values at Foodies is &lsquo;in it together&rsquo;. For us this is about looking after each other and backing each other in the good times, and the bad. We know that together, there&rsquo;s nothing that&rsquo;s too hard and that no journey is ever done alone. That&rsquo;s right across the North Island &ndash; from our stores, to our Support Centre and Supply Chain teams.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-2">
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s one of our team who is suddenly homeless from a natural disaster, someone who has just been diagnosed with a serious illness, or a parent facing the loss of a child, we want to be able to help, and help fast.</p>

<h2>Why we&#39;re doing it</h2>
</div>

<p class="small">We reckon we&rsquo;ve got the potential to make a real difference to our Foodies family through the tough times. We want to be a team with our eyes and ears open to others, to be generous and willing to share a little of what we have so that together we all keep going. The Foodies Foundation gives us our own very special way of doing this.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-3">
<div class="sub-heading-container"><span>2</span>

<h2>How it works</h2>
</div>

<p class="small">The Foodies Foundation will be funded by donations from our Members and employees. All Members or permanent and fixed term Foodstuffs North Island, store, Foodstuffs New Zealand, Foodstuffs Own Brands or Liquorland employees can make an application to the Foodies Foundation in times of need.</p>

<p class="small">Each month our Foodies Foundation Trustees &ndash; a mix of people from across our Co-op meet to decide where the funds go.</p>
</div>

<h2>Be part of it</h2>
</div>

<p class="small">There&#39;s a lot of us in the Foodies family, so we already know there are people who need our support straight away. We&#39;d love you to be part of it by donating, applying or helping fundraise &ndash; it&#39;ll only work if we&rsquo;re in it together. We&rsquo;re excited to see where this new chapter will take us. It&rsquo;s quite literally life changing stuff!</p>

        <p>When we say get more out of life we mean for the good stuff like opportunities to grow your career and learn new stuff, but it’s also for when things are grim and when getting more out of life looks like money for emergency surgery or a place to stay when your home is lost to flooding. <br /><br /> Life has a habit of throwing curve balls and sometimes we’re just not equipped to deal with them alone.</p> 
      </div> 
      <div class="col-2"> 
        <p>We reckon we’ve got the potential to make a real difference through these times, but if we’re going to do it well, we’re going to need to do it together. <br /><br /> So this year we’re launching a Foodies Foundation – a trust, to help us help each other in times of need. And by us we mean all 22,000 of us – across our Support Centre, Supply Chain and store teams.</p> <a class="button-watch-video" href="#">Watch the video</a>
